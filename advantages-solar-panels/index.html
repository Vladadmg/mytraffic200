<p>If you have been thinking about installing solar panels, there are plenty of great reasons to go ahead with your plans. You may have not considered all of the advantages of solar energy, but here are a few really great ones:</p>
<p>1. Solar Energy is abundant and will never “run out”. Fossil fuels like oil and gas are limited and the cost to retrieve those resources is massive in real money and in environmental destruction. Sunlight is everywhere and hits most areas of the earth. We even receive some sunlight on the cloudiest of days, so it can energize solar panels.</p>
<p>2. Solar power is free. Yes, you have to pay for the solar panels and other equipment, but that is an upfront cost or can be spread out in leasing payments. You will also receive rebates that you are eligible for in your local area. Once you have paid for the equipment you can enjoy your free electricity because you won’t be receiving a bill from your electrical utility each and every month.</p>

<p>3. Solar panels and the equipment that is required to operate them continue to evolve and become more cost effective. Although the initial cost of the equipment can be expensive, those costs have really come down over recent years and people are seeing a return on their investment in a much shorter amount of time with the cost of electricity continuing to rise exponentially.</p>
<p>4. Solar panels are non-polluting. Solar energy is emission free when it generates electricity. You do not have to worry that you are causing more damage to the environment because when you use solar energy. There are no carbon emissions and you are actually reducing your carbon footprint by using this type of energy. There is also no noise (like the noise associated with gasoline engines) in the production of this energy.</p>
<p>5. Solar Power is available in even the most remote location. It does not matter where your home (or home away from home) is located, you can access sunlight just about anywhere. Panels can be installed and you can begin generating your own electrical power, even where electricity is not available.</p>
<p>6. Solar energy systems require very little maintenance. The equipment required for solar energy production can be basically set up and forgotten about. There are no recurring costs and there is no need to revamp <a href="http://www.zerogen.com.au/spv-adelaide">Zerogen Australia</a> the system one it has been installed and is in place. The only cost is your up-front cost of purchasing the equipment.</p>
