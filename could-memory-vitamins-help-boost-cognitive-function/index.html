One of these is Dimethyl Amino Ethanol (DMAE) and is understood to enhance mental acuity and sharpness.<br />
<br/>This is since DMAE is exactly what is known as a dietary precursor to acetylcholine. In short, it is required for the manufacture of acetylcholine. Acetylcholine itself is a crucial neurotransmitter, essential for ideal brain functioning.<br />
<br/>Of course, with some uses of vitamins memory will be boosted to a higher degree than with other uses. The trick is in taking a memory-enhancing supplement in the method it <a href='http://www.amazingbodystore.com/cognitive/'>http://www.amazingbodystore.com/cognitive/</a> was designed to be taken. Most dietary supplements do not promise any effect whatsoever if they are taken in dosages various from those prescribed for the suitable age and sex of the individual in concern.
