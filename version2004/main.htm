2004 V2.1 enhances Microsoft Flight Simulator 2004’s AI Traffic. MyTraffic adds 
airliner, general aviation and military traffic, each implemented in the most 
realistic manner ever experienced in FS2004. Regardless of type of flying you 
do, MyTraffic 2004 will provide a truly ‘<b>as real as it gets</b>’ environment.</font></p>
<p><font color="#ff0000" face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Features:</b></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>2.450.000+ </b>weekly AI 
Flights – MyTraffic 2004 V2.1 includes over 2,450,000 (yes, that’s correct – 
almost two and a half a million) AI flights between 6,300 airports in <b>all 
regions of the world</b>. These flights include international, national, 
regional, commuter, general aviation, cargo, military operations and even touch 
and go circuits. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Flights </b>have been 
generated <b>based on a realistic model</b> - All traffic is generated based on 
real-life traffic patterns. You will see airlines at airports and hubs which are 
consistent with their real-world operations. MyTraffic 2004 also includes a set 
of long range flights based on published airline schedules giving you a high 
level of realism without the boring uniformity of products that restrict 
themselves solely to published schedules.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>6300+ Airports </b>bustling 
with AI Traffic – MyTraffic 2004 V2.1 flies AI Traffic between more than 5,900 
airports in all corners of the world. All aircraft behave realistically during 
different phases of their flight. Parking positions are also assigned in an 
accurate manner. For example, airliners will taxi to their specific company 
terminal and gates, cargo aircraft will park at cargo positions situated near 
the respective airport cargo facilities. AI Traffic will behave in the same way 
even at add-on sceneries, provided that they are fully FS2004 compatible.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Touch and Go flights</b> into more than 100 small 
airfields.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Airliner, General Aviation 
and Military Traffic - </b>With MyTraffic 2004 V2.1 you get yourself the only AI 
Traffic generator that treats all three types of aviation traffic with the same 
priority. You will not have to compromise one for the other!</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>1855+ Liveries – </b>

will keep growing.</font></p>

unnecessary array of features, menus and other distractions. It is our 
philosophy to keep MyTraffic 2004 as simple to use, yet as powerful as possible!
