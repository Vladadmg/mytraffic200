<p align="center"><b><font face="Verdana">MyTraffic 2004 FAQ </font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">How is MyTraffic 2004 different from 
MyTraffic for FS2002? </font></b></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Firstly, MyTraffic 2004 is 
FS2004 compatible. It has several thousand more flight plans than earlier 
versions of MyTraffic and includes several new models of aircraft and liveries. 
In the current version there are: </font></p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">500000+ flight plans</font></li>
	<li>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">5500 + airports</font></li>
	<li>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">62 different aircraft 
	models</font></li>
	<li>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">1080+ paints </font></li>
</ul>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Furthermore, the number of 
airports which MyTraffic co-ordinates traffic between has been increased. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify"><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Is the mechanism of traffic 
in FS2004 the same as FS2002? How have these changes affected MyTraffic? </font>
</b></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">FS2004 handles AI traffic 
differently to FS2002. In addition to improvements in traffic movements in the 
air and on the ground, FS2004 has a new location where traffic data is stored: 
[FS2004] \Scenery\World\scenery </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">FS can now handle multiple bgl 
files containing AI traffic data. Hence it is possible to use almost any AI 
add-on along with MyTraffic. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">This means that in order to 
modify ground behavior like adding gates, at least parts of the airports have to 
be completely changed. Once an SDK reveals details we expect add-on airports to 
appear featuring improved traffic behavior as opposed to the default airports, 
preventing cargo and military aircraft from parking at passenger terminals. The 
MyTraffic team will participate in this process and provide add-on airports 
optimized for traffic. We will help other add-on developers to get their 
airports compatible with FS2004 taxiway networks </font></p>
