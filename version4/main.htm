<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1">Keeping with the tradition of 
including never-seen-before features, this iteration of MyTraffic introduces the 
'AI Time Machine', allowing users to simulate traffic from any year in the past 
half century. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1">In addition to this 
revolutionary new feature, MyTraffic now includes both Naval (previously sold as 
a separate add-on) and amphibious AI traffic. Furthermore, the new version 
includes at least 50 new AI optimized aircraft models (including retired 
aircraft such as the<br>
Concord) and several completely redesigned versions of existing models. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1">To accommodate for the AI Time 
Machine, the internal workings of the Editor have been overhauled to integrate 
more complex algorithms, support for multi-threading and the addition of a more 
user friendly method to add individual flights. The Editor now includes data 
about retired aircraft, old liveries and defunct airlines. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1">Overall, MyTraffic includes 
530,000 daily flights (civil, military, amphibious and general aviation traffic), 
and now the ability to simulate traffic from any year starting with the 1950s: 
this clearly places it ahead of its competition.</font></p>
<p><font color="#ff0000" face="Verdana" size="1"><b>Features:</b></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>3.700.000+ </b>weekly AI 
Flights – MyTraffic 2006 includes over 3,700,000 (yes, that's correct - almost 
four million) AI flights between 6,500 airports in all regions of the world. 
These flights include international, national, regional, commuter, general 
aviation, cargo, amphibian airlines, military and naval operations, even from 
carriers, and touch and go circuits. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>Flights </b>have been 
generated <b>based on a realistic model</b> - All traffic is generated based on 
real-life traffic patterns. You will see airlines at airports and hubs which are 
consistent with their real-world operations. MyTraffic 2006 also includes a set 
of long range flights based on published airline schedules giving you a high 
level of realism without the boring uniformity of products that restrict 
themselves solely to published schedules.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>6500+ Airports </b>bustling 
with AI Traffic – MyTraffic 2006 flies AI Traffic between more than 6,500 
airports in all corners of the world. All aircraft behave realistically during 
different phases of their flight. Parking positions are also assigned in an 
accurate manner. For example, airliners will taxi to their specific company 
terminal and gates, cargo aircraft will park at cargo positions situated near 
the respective airport cargo facilities. AI Traffic will behave in the same way 
even at add-on sceneries, provided that they are fully FS2004 compatible.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>Touch and Go flights</b> into more than 100 
small airfields.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>Airliner, General Aviation 
and Military Traffic - </b>With MyTraffic 2006 you get yourself the only AI 
Traffic generator that treats<b> all three types of aviation traffic</b> with 
the same priority. You will not have to compromise one for the other! And not 
only for current schedules, even going back in history to the beginning of the 
jet age.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>2560+ Liveries – </b>
MyTraffic 2006 includes well over 2560 aircraft liveries and this number will 
keep growing.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>161+ Aircraft Models </b>- 
From Boeing to Yakolevs and Cessnas to Embraers, MyTraffic includes them all. 
All models are created with GMAX optimized for high frame rates even at very 
busy airports. Aircraft which have been newly added to MT2004 include older 
aircrafts like Concorde, Tristar, Caravelle, Metropolitan, newest models like 
Embraer 170 and 190, military models like the Eurofighter, Tornado and all the 
Naval aircraft models, and much more. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>Simplicity is the key</b> - 
MyTraffic2006 is simple by virtue. We do not overload our add-on with an 
unnecessary array of features, menus and other distractions. It is our 
philosophy to keep MyTraffic 2006 as simple to use, yet as powerful as possible!
</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1"><b>MyTraffic 2006 Editor </b>is 
an advanced AI Traffic configuration utility allowing the generation of 
thousands of flight plans at the click of a button, all based on user adjustable 
parameters. Capable of recognizing geographic regions, country borders, and the 
history of airline fleets, the editor makes sure that you see the right traffic 
in the right region. </font></p>
